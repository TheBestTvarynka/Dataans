# Contributing

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to this project :heart:. We appreciate your effort and time in making OSS better.

We'll help to set up the environment, explain needed parts of the code, discuss implementation, and review the code.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repo: https://github.com/TheBestTvarynka/Dataans/fork.
2. Set up local development environment: [TheBestTvarynka/Dataans#development](https://github.com/TheBestTvarynka/Dataans/tree/main/dataans#development).
3. Make changes and commit them to your development branch.
4. Push commits to your repo.
5. Create a pull request with a proper title and description.

## Commit messages

We don't have a strict style guide for the commit messages. Your pull request will be [squashed and merged](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-commits) anyway. The only restriction we have is our [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](https://github.com/TheBestTvarynka/Dataans/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please, follow this policy :blush:.

## Code style

Refer to the [`STYLE.md`](/doc/STYLE.md) document to read about the code style guidelines.

## What to contribute?

If you want to implement a missing/wanting feature, then create a discussion, discuss it with maintainer(s), get approval, and start working on it.

If you want to fix a bug, then create an issue/discussion, discuss possible solutions with maintainer(s), get approval, and start fixing it.

If you don't know what to implement, then you can browse [existing issues](https://github.com/TheBestTvarynka/Dataans/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) or ask for help in [the discussions](https://github.com/TheBestTvarynka/Dataans/discussions). We always have something to do :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.
