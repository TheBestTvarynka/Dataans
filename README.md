# Dataans

## Overview

`Dataans` is a note-taking app. The idea is to take notes in the form of markdown snippets grouped into spaces. Imagine multiple Telegram _Saved Messages_ chats with markdown support. The `Dataans` is something like that. If you have a lot of saved messages or personal channels in Telegram (or in any other favorite social network), you should give this app a try.

## Motivation

Have you noticed how convenient and easy it is to take notes in Telegram or any other messaging app? The idea was to create a note-taking app where notes are small *markdown* snippets grouped in spaces. Such notes are easy to create, read, search, and edit. In addition, there are several other particularly important features:

**_Desktop app_**. Usually, the browser has dozens of open tabs across multiple windows. It becomes hard to find the tab with notes (even when it's pinned).

> _FYI, the app window is also hard to find when you have a dozen other windows_ :raised_eyebrow:.

Yes, you are right. This is why the second most important feature is the **_drop-down mode (quake mode)_**. You don't need to track the window location/position. You open/hide it using the global configurable shortcut :sunglasses:.

**_Cross platform_**. This app supports **Windows** and **Linux**. It can be compiled on macOS as well, but it hasn't been tested on it. So, you can try using it on macOS, but you may encounter more bugs.

There are many similar existing apps, but all of them have one or more major flaws. You can read more about motivation and features in the blog post: https://tbt.qkation.com/projects/dataans/.

## Installation

You can download the app installer here: https://github.com/TheBestTvarynka/Dataans/releases. Or alternatively,y you can build the app from source code: https://github.com/TheBestTvarynka/Dataans/tree/main/dataans#installation

## App philosophy

### The worse is better

Did you hear about [the _worse-is-better_ philosophy](https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html)? If not, I encourage you to read [The Rise of Worse is Better](https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html) article.

TL;DR. This is a citation from the mentioned article above:

> The worse-is-better philosophy:
>   - Simplicity -- the design must be simple, both in implementation and interface. It is more important for the implementation to be simple than the interface.
>   - Correctness -- the design must be correct in all observable aspects. It is slightly better to be simple than correct.
>   - Consistency -- the design must not be overly inconsistent. Consistency can be sacrificed for simplicity in some cases, but it is better to drop those parts of the design that deal with less common circumstances than to introduce either implementational complexity or inconsistency.
>   - Completeness -- the design must cover as many important situations as is practical. All reasonably expected cases should be covered. Completeness can be sacrificed in favor of any other quality. Consistency can be sacrificed to achieve completeness if simplicity is retained.

:thinking: What does it mean for the app? It means that the implementation is always _straightforward_, only _common use cases_ are covered, and only _wanted and valuable features_ are implemented.

If you lack any functionality or you face a bug, then report it ([issue](https://github.com/TheBestTvarynka/Dataans/issues/new) or [discussion](https://github.com/TheBestTvarynka/Dataans/discussions)). Any reasonable/valuable bugs/features will be fixed/implemented!

### BDFL

Did you hear about [BDFL](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life)?

TL;DR:

> **Benevolent dictator for life (BDFL)** is a title given to a small number of open-source software development leaders, typically project founders who retain the final say in disputes or arguments within the community.

For the Dataans project, the BDFL is [@TheBestTvarynka (Pavlo Myroniuk)](https://github.com/TheBestTvarynka), original creator of Dataans.
